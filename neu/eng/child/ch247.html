<PRE>

247A.1	 &#145;HOW brent&#146;s your brow, my Lady Elspat!
	 How golden yallow is your hair!
	 Of all the maids of fair Scotland,
	 There&#146;s nane like Lady Elspat fair.&#146;
247A.2	 &#145;Perform your vows, Sweet William,&#146; she says,
	 &#145;The vows which ye ha made to me,
	 An at the back o my mother&#146;s castle
	 This night I&#146;ll surely meet wi thee.&#146;
247A.3	 But wae be to her brother&#146;s page,
	 Who heard the words this twa did say!
	 He&#146;s told them to her lady mother,
	 Who wrought Sweet William mieckle wae.
247A.4	 For she has taen him Sweet William,
	 An she&#146;s gard bind him wi his bow-string
	 Till the red bluide o his fair body
	 Frae ilka nail o his hand did spring.
247A.5	 O it fell once upon a time
	 That the Lord Justice came to town;
	 Out has she taen him Sweet William,
	 Brought him before Lord Justice boun.
247A.6	 &#145;An what is the crime, now, madame,&#146; he says,
	 &#145;Has been committed by this young man?&#146;
	 &#145;O he has broken my bonny castel,
	 That was well biggit with lime and stane.
247A.7	 &#145;An he has broken my bonny coffers,
	 That was well banded wi aiken ban,
	 An he has stoln my rich jewels;
	 I wot he has them every one.&#146;
247A.8	 Then out it spake her Lady Elspat,
	 As she sat by Lord Justice knee;
	 &#145;Now ye hae taul your tale, mother,
	 I pray, Lord Justice, you&#146;l now hear me.
247A.9	 &#145;He has na broken her bonny castel,
	 That was well biggit wi lime and stane,
	 Nor has he stoln her rich jewels,
	 For I wot she has them every one.
247A.10	 &#145;But tho he was my first true love,
	 An tho I had sworn to be his bride,
	 Cause he had not a great estate,
	 She would this way our loves divide.&#146;
247A.11	 An out it spake the Lord Justice,
	 I wot the tear was in his ee;
	 &#145;I see nae fault in this young man,
	 Sae loose his bans, an set him free.
247A.12	 &#145;Take back your love, Lady Elspat,
	 An my best blessing you baith upon!
	 For gin he be your first true love,
	 He is my eldest sister&#146;s son.
247A.13	 &#145;There is a steed in my stable
	 Cost me baith gold and white money;
	 Ye&#146;s get as mieckle o my free lan
	 As he&#146;ll ride about in a summer&#146;s day.&#146;

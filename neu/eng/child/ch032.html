<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">32: King Henry</H1>
<PRE>

32.1	LAT never a man a wooing wend
	That lacketh thingis three;
	A routh o gold, an open heart,
	Ay fu o charity.
32.2	As this I speak of King Henry,
	For he lay burd-alone;
	An he&#146;s doen him to a jelly hunt&#146;s ha,
	Was seven miles frae a town.
32.3	He chas&#146;d the deer now him before,
	An the roe down by the den,
	Till the fattest buch in a&#146; the flock
	King Henry he has slain.
32.4	O he has doen him to his ha,
	To make him beerly cheer;
	An in it came a griesly ghost,
	Steed stappin i the fleer.
32.5	Her head hat the reef-tree o the house,
	Her middle ye mot wel span;
	He&#146;s thrown to her his gay mantle,
	Says, &#145;Lady, hap your lingcan.&#146;
32.6	Her teeth was a&#146; like teather stakes,
	Her nose like club or mell;
	An I ken naething she &#146;peard to be,
	But the fiend that wons in hell.
32.7	&#145;Some meat, some meat, ye King Henry,
	Some meat ye gie to me!&#146;
	&#145;An what meat&#146;s in this house, lady,
	An what ha I to gie?&#146;
	&#145;O ye do kill your berry-brown steed,
	An you bring him here to me.&#146;
32.8	O whan he slew his berry-brown steed,
	Wow but his heart was sair!
	Shee eat him [a&#146;] up, skin an bane,
	Left naething but hide an hair.
32.9	&#145;Mair meat, mair meat, ye King Henry,
	Mair meat ye gi to me!&#146;
	&#145;An what meat&#146;s in this house, lady,
	An what ha I to gi?&#146;
	&#145;O ye do kill your good gray-hounds,
	An ye bring them a&#146; to me.&#146;
32.10	O whan he slew his good gray-hounds,
	Wow but his heart was sair!
	She eat them a&#146; up, skin an bane,
	Left naething but hide an hair.
32.11	&#145;Mair meat, mair meat, ye King Henry,
	Mair meat ye gi to me!&#146;
	&#145;An what meat&#146;s i this house, lady,
	An what ha I to gi?&#146;
	&#145;O ye do kill your gay gos-hawks,
	An ye bring them here to me.&#146;
32.12	O whan he slew his gay gos-hawks,
	Wow but his heart was sair!
	She eat them a&#146; up, skin an bane,
	Left naething but feathers bare.
32.13	&#145;Some drink, some drink, now, King Henry,
	Some drink ye bring to me!&#146;
	&#145;O what drink&#146;s i this house, lady,
	That you&#146;re nae welcome ti?&#146;
	&#145;O ye sew up your horse&#146;s hide,
	An bring in a drink to me.&#146;
32.14	And he&#146;s sewd up the bloody hide,
	A puncheon o wine put in;
	She drank it a&#146; up at a waught,
	Left na ae drap ahin.
32.15	&#145;A bed, a bed, now, King Henry,
	A bed you mak to me!
	For ye maun pu the heather green,
	An mak a bed to me.&#146;
32.16	O pu&#146;d has he the heather green,
	An made to her a bed,
	An up has he taen his gay mantle,
	An oer it has he spread.
32.17	&#145;Tak aff your claiths, now, King Henry,
	An lye down by my side!&#146;
	&#145;O God forbid,&#146; says King Henry,
	&#145;That ever the like betide;
	That ever the fiend that wons in hell
	Shoud streak down by my side.&#146;
	* * * * *
32.18	Whan night was gane, and day was come,
	An the sun shone throw the ha,
	The fairest lady that ever was seen
	Lay atween him an the wa.
32.19	&#145;O well is me!&#146; says King Henry,
	&#145;How lang&#146;ll this last wi me?&#146;
	Then out it spake that fair lady,
	&#145;Even till the day you dee.
32.20	&#145;For I&#146;ve met wi mony a gentle knight
	That&#146;s gien me sic a fill,
	But never before wi a courteous knight
	That ga me a&#146; my will.&#146;

<PRE>

124A.1	 IN Wakefield there lives a jolly pinder,
	 In Wakefield, all on a green;
	 In Wakefield, all on a green;
124A.2	 &#145;There is neither knight nor squire,&#146; said the pinder,
	 &#145;Nor baron that is so bold,
	 &#145;Nor baron that is so bold,
	 Dare make a trespasse to the town of Wakefield,
	 But his pledge goes to the pinfold.&#146;
	 But his pledge goes to the pinfold.&#146;
124A.3	 All this beheard three witty young men,
	 &#146;Twas Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John;
	 With that they spyed the jolly pinder,
	 As he sate under a thorn.
124A.4	 &#145;Now turn again, turn again,&#146; said the pinder,
	 &#145;For a wrong way have you gone;
	 For you have forsaken the king his highway,
	 And made a path over the corn.&#146;
124A.5	 &#145;O that were great shame,&#146; said jolly Robin,
	 &#145;We being three, and thou but one:&#146;
	 The pinder leapt back then thirty good foot,
	 &#146;Twas thirty good foot and one.
124A.6	 He leaned his back fast unto a thorn,
	 And his foot unto a stone,
	 And there he fought a long summer&#146;s day,
	 A summer&#146;s day so long,
	 Till that their swords, on their broad bucklers,
	 Were broken fast unto their hands.
	 * * * * *
124A.7	 &#145;Hold thy hand, hold thy hand,&#146; said Robin Hood,
	 &#145;And my merry men euery one;
	 For this is one of the best pinders
	 That ever I try&#146;d with sword.
124A.8	 &#145;And wilt thou forsake thy pinder his craft,
	 And live in [the] green wood with me?
	 . . . .
	 . . . .
124A.9	 &#145;At Michaelmas next my covnant comes out,
	 When every man gathers his fee;
	 I&#146;le take my blew blade all in my hand,
	 And plod to the green wood with thee.&#146;
124A.10	 &#145;Hast thou either meat or drink,&#146; said Robin Hood,
	 &#145;For my merry men and me?
	 . . . .
	 . . . .
124A.11	 &#145;I have both bread and beef,&#146; said the pinder,
	 &#145;And good ale of the best;&#146;
	 &#145;And that is meat good enough,&#146; said Robin Hood,
	 &#145;For such unbidden guest.
124A.12	 wilt thou forsake the pinder his craft,
	 And go to the green wood with me?
	 Thou shalt have a livery twice in the year,
	 The one green, the other brown [shall be].&#146;
124A.13	 &#145;If Michaelmas day were once come and gone
	 And my master had paid me my fee,
	 Then would I set as little by him
	 As my master doth set by me.&#146;

124B.*	 * * *
	 &#145;BUT hold y . . hold y . . . &#146; says Robin,
	 &#145;My merrymen, I bid yee,
	 For this [is] one of the best pindars
	 That euer I saw with mine eye.
124B.2	 &#145;But hast thou any meat, thou iolly pindar,
	 For my merrymen and me?&#146;
	 . . . .
	 . . . .
124B.3	 &#145;But I haue bread and cheese,&#146; sayes the pindar,
	 &#145;And ale all on the best:&#146;
	 &#145;That&#146;s cheere good enoughe,&#146; said Robin,
	 &#145;For any such vnbidden guest.
124B.4	 &#145;But wilt be my man?&#146; said good Robin,
	 &#145;And come and dwell with me?
	 And twise in a yeere thy clothing [shall] be changed
	 If my man thou wilt bee,
	 The tone shall be of light Lincolne greene,
	 The tother of Picklory.&#146;
124B.5	 &#145;Att Michallmas comes a well good time,
	 When men haue gotten in their fee;
	 I&#146;le sett as litle by my master
	 As he now setts by me,
	 I&#146;le take my benbowe in my hande,
	 And come into the grenwoode to thee.&#146;

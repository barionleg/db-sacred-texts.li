<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">259A: Lord Thomas Stuart</H1>
<PRE>

259A.1	 THOMAS STUART was a lord,
	 A lord of mickle land;
	 He used to wear a coat of gold,
	 But now his grave is green.
259A.2	 Now he has wooed the young countess,
	 The Countess of Balquhin,
	 An given her for a morning-gift
	 Strathboggie and Aboyne.
259A.3	 But women&#146;s wit is aye willful,
	 Alas that ever it was sae!
	 She longed to see the morning-gift
	 That her gude lord to her gae.
259A.4	 When steeds were saddled an weel bridled,
	 An ready for to ride,
	 There came a pain on that gude lord,
	 His back, likewise his side.
259A.5	 He said, Ride on, my lady fair,
	 May goodness be your guide!
	 For I&#146;m sae sick and weary that
	 No farther can I ride.
259A.6	 Now ben did come his father dear,
	 Wearing a golden band;
	 Says, Is there nae leech in Edinburgh
	 Can cure my son from wrang?
259A.7	 &#145;O leech is come, an leech is gane,
	 Yet, father, I&#146;m aye waur;
	 There&#146;s not a leech in Edinbro
	 Can death from me debar.
259A.8	 &#145;But be a friend to my wife, father,
	 Restore to her her own;
	 Restore to her my morning-gift,
	 Strathboggie and Aboyne.
259A.9	 &#145;It had been gude for my wife, father,
	 To me she&#146;d born a son;
	 He would have got my land an rents,
	 Where they lie out an in.
259A.10	 &#145;It had been gude for my wife, father,
	 To me she&#146;d born an heir;
	 He would have got my lands an rents,
	 Where they lie fine and fair.&#146;
259A.11	 The steeds they strave into their stables,
	 The boys could&#146;nt get them bound;
	 The hounds lay howling on the leech,
	 Cause their master was behind.
259A.12	 &#145;I dreamed a dream since late yestreen,
	 I wish it may be good,
	 That our chamber was full of swine,
	 An our bed full of blood.&#146;
259A.13	 I saw a woman come from the West,
	 Full sore wringing her hands,
	 And aye she cried, Ohon, alas!
	 My good lord&#146;s broken bands.
259A.14	 As she came by my good lord&#146;s bower,
	 Saw mony black steeds an brown:
	 &#145;I&#146;m feared it be mony unco lords
	 Havin my love from town!&#146;
259A.15	 As she came by my gude lord&#146;s bower,
	 Saw mony black steeds an grey:
	 &#145;I&#146;m feared it&#146;s mony unco lords
	 Havin my love to the clay!&#146;

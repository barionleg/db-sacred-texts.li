<PRE>

130A.1	 THEN bold Robin Hood to the north he would go,
	 With a hey down down a down down
	 With valour and mickle might,
	 With sword by his side, which oft had been tri&#146;d,
	 To fight and recover his right.
130A.2	 The first that he met was a bony bold Scot,
	 His servant he said he would be;
	 &#145;No,&#146; quoth Robin Hood, &#146;it cannot be good,
	 For thou wilt prove false unto me.
130A.3	 &#145;Thou hast not bin true to sire nor cuz:&#146;
	 &#145;Nay, marry,&#146; the Scot he said,
	 &#145;As true as your heart, I&#146;le never part,
	 Gude master, be not afraid.&#146;
	 * * * * *
130A.4	 Then Robin Hood turnd his face to the east;
	 &#145;Fight on my merry men stout,
	 Our cause is good,&#146; quoth brave Robin Hood,
	 &#145;And we shall not be beaten out.&#146;
130A.5	 The battel grows hot on every side,
	 The Scotchman made great moan;
	 Quoth Jockey, Gude faith, they fight on each side;
	 Would I were with my wife Ione!
130A.6	 The enemy compast brave Robin about,
	 &#146;Tis long ere the battel ends;
	 Ther&#146;s neither will yeeld nor give up the field,
	 For both are supplied with friends.
	 * * * * *
130A.7	 This song it was made in Robin Hoods dayes;
	 Let&#146;s pray unto Iove above
	 To give us true peace, that mischief may cease,
	 And war may give place unto love.

<PRE>

130B.1	 NOW bold Robin Hood to the north would go,
	 With valour and mickle might,
	 With sword by his side, which oft had been try&#146;d,
	 To fight and recover his right.
130B.2	 The first that he met was a jolly stout Scot,
	 His servant he said he would be;
	 &#145;No,&#146; quoth Robin Hood, &#146;it cannot be good,
	 For thou wilt prove false unto me.
130B.3	 &#145;Thou hast not been true to sire or cuz;&#146;
	 &#145;Nay, marry,&#146; the Scot he said,
	 &#145;As true as your heart, I never will part;
	 Good master, be not afraid.&#146;
130B.4	 &#145;But eer I employ you,&#146; said bold Robin Hood,
	 &#145;With you I must have a bout;&#146;
	 The Scotchman reply&#146;d, Let the battle be try&#146;d,
	 For I know I will beat you out.
130B.5	 Thus saying, the contest did quickly begin,
	 Which lasted two hours and more;
	 The blows Sawney gave bold Robin so brave
	 The battle soon made him give oer.
130B.6	 &#145;Have mercy, thou Scotchman,&#146; bold Robin Hood cry&#146;d,
	 &#145;Full dearly this boon have I bought;
	 We will both agree, and my man you shall be,
	 For a stouter I never have fought.&#146;
130B.7	 Then Sawny consented with Robin to go,
	 To be of his bowmen so gay;
	 Thus ended the fight, and with mickle delight
	 To Sherwood they hasted away.

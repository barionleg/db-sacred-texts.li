<PRE>

265A.1	 &#145;THERE is a fashion in this land,
	 And even come to this country,
	 That every lady should meet her lord
	 When he is newly come frae sea:
265A.2	 &#145;Some wi hawks, and some wi hounds,
	 And other some wi gay monie;
	 Bit I will gae myself alone,
	 And set his young son on his knee.&#146;
265A.3	 She&#146;s taen her young son in her arms,
	 And nimbly walkd by yon sea-strand,
	 And there she spy&#146;d her father&#146;s ship,
	 As she was sailing to dry land.
265A.4	 &#145;Where hae ye put my ain gude lord,
	 This day he stays sae far frae me?&#146;
	 &#145;If ye be wanting your ain gude lord,
	 A sight o him ye&#146;ll never see.&#146;
265A.5	 &#145;Was he brunt? or was he shot?
	 Or was he drowned in the sea?
	 Or what&#146;s become o my ain gude lord,
	 That he will neer appear to me?&#146;
265A.6	 &#145;He wasna brunt, nor was he shot,
	 Nor was he drowned in the sea;
	 He was slain in Dunfermling,
	 A fatal day to you and me.&#146;
265A.7	 &#145;Come in, come in, my merry young men,
	 Come in and drink the wine wi me;
	 And a&#146; the better ye shall fare
	 For this gude news ye tell to me.&#146;
265A.8	 She&#146;s brought them down to yon cellar,
	 She brought them fifty steps and three;
	 She birled wi them the beer and wine,
	 Till they were as drunk as drunk could be.
265A.9	 Then she has lockd her cellar-door,
	 For there were fifty steps and three:
	 &#145;Lie there, wi my sad malison,
	 For this bad news ye&#146;ve tauld to me.&#146;
265A.10	 She&#146;s taen the keys intill her hand
	 And threw them deep, deep in the sea:
	 &#145;Lie there, wi my sad malison,
	 Till my gude lord return to me.&#146;
265A.11	 Then she sat down in her own room,
	 And sorrow lulld her fast asleep,
	 And up it starts her own gude lord,
	 And even at that lady&#146;s feet.
265A.12	 &#145;Take here the keys, Janet,&#146; he says,
	 &#145;That ye threw deep, deep in the sea;
	 And ye&#146;ll relieve my merry young men,
	 For they&#146;ve nane o the swick o me.
265A.13	 &#145;They shot the shot, and drew the stroke,
	 And wad in red bluid to the knee;
	 Nae sailors mair for their lord coud do
	 Nor my young men they did for me.&#146;
265A.14	 &#145;I hae a question at you to ask,
	 Before that ye depart frae me;
	 You&#146;ll tell to me what day I&#146;ll die,
	 And what day will my burial be?&#146;
265A.15	 &#145;I hae nae mair o God&#146;s power
	 Than he has granted unto me;
	 But come to heaven when ye will,
	 There porter to you I will be.
265A.16	 &#145;But ye&#146;ll be wed to a finer knight
	 Than ever was in my degree;
	 Unto him ye&#146;ll hae children nine,
	 And six o them will be ladies free.
265A.17	 &#145;The other three will be bold young men,
	 To fight for king and countrie;
	 The ane a duke, the second a knight,
	 And third a laird o lands sae free.&#146;

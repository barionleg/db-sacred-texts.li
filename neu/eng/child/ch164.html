<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">164A: King Henry Fifth&#146;s Conquest of France</H1>
<PRE>

164A.1	 AS our king lay musing on his bed,
	 He bethought himself upon a time
	 Of a tribute that was due from France,
	 Had not been paid for so long a time.
	 Fal, lal, etc.
164A.2	 He called for his lovely page,
	 His lovely page then called he,
	 Saying, You must go to the king of France,
	 To the king of France, sir, ride speedily.
164A.3	 O then went away this lovely page,
	 This lovely page then away went he;
	 And when he came to the king of France,
	 Low he fell down on his bended knee.
164A.4	 &#145;My master greets you, worthy sir;
	 Ten ton of gold that is due to he,
	 That you will send him his tribute home,
	 Or in French land you soon will him see.&#146;
164A.5	 &#145;Your master&#146;s young and of tender years,
	 Not fir to come into my degree,
	 And I will send him three tennis-balls,
	 That with them he may learn to play.&#146;
164A.6	 O then returned this lovely page,
	 This lovely page then returned he,
	 And when he came to our gracious king,
	 Low he fell down on his bended knee.
164A.7	 &#145;What news, what news, my trusty page?
	 What is the news you have brought to me?&#146;
	 &#145;I have brought such news from the king of France
	 That you and he will never agree.
164A.8	 &#145;He says you&#146;re young and of tender years,
	 Not fit to come into his degree,
	 And he will send you three tennis-balls,
	 That with them you may learn to play.&#146;
164A.9	 &#145;Recruit me Cheshire and Lancashire,
	 And Derby Hills that are so free;
	 No marryd man nor no widow&#146;s son;
	 For no widow&#146;s curse shall go with me.&#146;
164A.10	 They recruited Cheshire and Lancashire,
	 And Derby Hills that are so free;
	 No marryd man, nor no widow&#146;s son;
	 Yet there was a jovial bold company.
164A.11	 O then we marchd into the French land,
	 With drums and trumpets so merrily;
	 And then bespoke the king of France,
	 &#145;Lo, yonder comes proud King Henry.&#146;
164A.12	 The first shot that the Frenchmen gave,
	 They killd our Englishmen so free;
	 We killd ten thousand of the French,
	 And the rest of them they ran away.
164A.13	 And then we marched to Paris gates,
	 With drums and trumpets so merrily:
	 O then bespoke the king of France,
	 &#145;The Lord have mercy on my men and me!
164A.14	 &#145;O I will send him his tribute home,
	 Ten ton of gold that is due to he,
	 And the finest flower that is in all France
	 To the Rose of England I will give free.&#146;

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">296A: Walter Lesly</H1>
<PRE>

296A.1	 On the second of October, a Monday at noon,
	 In came Walter Lesly, to see his proper one;
	 He sent a chair down by her side, and gently sat her by,
	 Says, Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?
296A.2	 He&#146;s taen a glass into his hand, inviting her to drink,
	 But little knew she his meaning, or what the rogue did think;
	 Nor what the rogue did think, to steal the maid away;
	 &#145;Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?&#146;
296A.3	 When they had taen a glass or two, and all were making merry,
	 In came Geordy Lesly, and forth he did her carry;
	 Then upon high horseback sae hard&#146;s he did her tye,
	 &#145;Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?&#146;
296A.4	 Her mother she came to the door, the saut tears on her cheek,
	 She coudna see her daughter, it was for dust and reek;
	 It was for dust and reek, the swords they glancd sae high;
	 &#145;And will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?&#146;
296A.5	 When they came to the ale-house, the people there were busy;
	 A bridal-bed it was well made, and supper well made ready;
	 When the supper down was set, baith plum-pudding and pie,
	 &#145;And will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?&#146;
296A.6	 When they had eaten and well drunken, and a&#146; man bound for bed,
	 The laddie and the lassie in ae chamber were laid;
	 He quickly stript her to the smock, and gently laid her bye,
	 Says, Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?
296A.7	 But Walter being weary, he fell fast asleep,
	 And then the lassie thought it fit to start up till her feet;
	 To start up till her feet, and her petticoats to tye,
	 &#145;We&#146;ll go no more to Conland, the winter-time to lye.&#146;
296A.8	 Then over moss and over muir sae cleverly she ran,
	 And over hill and over dale, without stockings or shoon;
	 The men pursued her full fast, wi mony shout and cry,
	 Says, Will ye go to Conland, the winter-time to lye.
296A.9	 &#145;Wae to the dubs o Duffus land, that eer they were sae deep;
	 They&#146;ve trachled a&#146; our horsemen and gart our captain sleep;
	 And gart our captain sleep, and the lassie win away,
	 And she&#146;ll go no more to Conland, the winter-time to lye.&#146;
296A.10	 &#145;I&#146;d rather be in Duffus land, selling at the ale,
	 Before I was wi Lesly, for a&#146; his auld meal;
	 For a&#146; his auld meal, and sae mony comes to buy;
	 I&#146;ll go no more to Conland the winter-time to lye.
296A.11	 &#145;I&#146;d rather be in Duffus land, draggin at the ware,
	 Before I was wi Lesly, for a&#146; his yellow hair;
	 For a&#146; his yellow hair, and sae well&#146;s he can it tye;
	 I&#146;ll go no more to Conland, this winter-time to lye.&#146;
296A.12	 It was not for her beauty, nor yet her gentle bluid,
	 But for her mither&#146;s dollars, of them he had great need;
	 Of them he had great need, now he maun do them by,
	 For she&#146;ll go no more to Conland, this winter-time to lye.

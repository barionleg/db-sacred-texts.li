<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">82: The Bonny Birdy</H1>
<PRE>

82.1	THERE was a knight, in a summer&#146;s night,
	Was riding oer the lee, diddle
	An there he saw a bonny birdy,
	Was singing upon a tree. diddle
82.1b	O wow for day! diddle
	An dear gin it were day! diddle
	Gin it were day, an gin I were away!
	For I ha na lang time to stay. diddle
82.2	&#145;Make hast, make hast, ye gentle knight,
	What keeps you here so late?
	Gin ye kent what was doing at hame,
	I fear you woud look blate.&#146;
82.3	&#145;O what needs I toil day an night,
	My fair body to kill,
	Whan I hae knights at my comman,
	An ladys at my will?&#146;
82.4	&#145;Ye lee, ye lee, ye gentle knight,
	Sa loud&#146;s I hear you lee;
	Your lady&#146;s a knight in her arms twa
	That she lees far better nor the.&#146;
82.5	&#145;Ye lee, you lee, you bonny birdy,
	How you lee upo my sweet!
	I will tak out my bonny bow,
	An in troth I will you sheet.&#146;
82.6	&#145;But afore ye hae your bow well bent,
	An a&#146; your arrows yare,
	I will flee till another tree,
	Whare I can better fare.&#146;
82.7	&#145;O whare was you gotten, and whare was ye clecked?
	My bonny birdy, tell me:&#146;
	&#145;O I was clecked in good green wood,
	My bonny birdy, tell me:&#146;
	&#145;O I was clecked in good green wood,
	Intill a holly tree;
	A gentleman my nest herryed,
	An ga me to his lady.
82.8	&#145;Wi good white bread an farrow-cow milk
	He bade her feed me aft,
	An ga her a little wee simmer-dale wanny,
	To ding me sindle and saft.
82.9	&#145;Wi good white bread an farrow-cow milk
	I wot she fed me nought,
	But wi a little wee simmer-dale wanny
	She dang me sair an aft:
	Gin she had deen as ye her bade,
	I woudna tell how she has wrought.&#146;
82.10	The knight he rade, and the birdy flew,
	The live-lang simmer&#146;s night,
	Till he came till his lady&#146;s bowr-door,
	Then even down he did light:
	The birdy sat on the crap of a tree,
	An I wot it sang fu dight.
82.11b	&#145;O wow for day! diddle
	An dear gin it were day! diddle
	Gin it were day, an gin I were away!
	For I ha na lang time to stay.&#146; diddle
82.12	&#145;What needs ye lang for day, diddle.
	An wish that you were away? diddle
	Is no your hounds i my cellar,
	Eating white meal an gray?&#146; diddle
82.12b	O wow, etc.
82.13	&#145;Is nae your steed in my stable,
	Eating good corn an hay?
	An is nae your hawk i my perch-tree,
	Just perching for his prey?
	An is nae yoursel i my arms twa?
	Then how can ye lang for day?&#146;
82.14b	&#145;O wow for day! diddle
	An dear gin it were day! diddle
??	&#145;O wow for day! diddle
	An dear gin it were day! diddle
??	&#145;O wow for day! diddle
	An dear gin it were day! diddle
	For he that&#146;s in bed wi anither man&#146;s wife
	Has never lang time to stay.&#146; diddle
82.15	Then out the knight has drawn his sword,
	An straiked it oer a strae,
	An thro and thro the fa&#146;se knight&#146;s waste
	He gard cauld iron gae:
	An I hope ilk ane sal sae be servd
	That treats ane honest man sae.

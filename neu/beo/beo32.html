<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XXXIII</H1>
THEN the baleful fiend its fire belched out,<BR>
and bright homes burned. The blaze stood high<BR>
all landsfolk frighting. No living thing<BR>
would that loathly one leave as aloft it flew.<BR>
Wide was the dragon's warring seen,<BR>
its fiendish fury far and near,<BR>
as the grim destroyer those Geatish people<BR>
hated and hounded. To hidden lair,<BR>
to its hoard it hastened at hint of dawn.<BR>
Folk of the land it had lapped in flame,<BR>
with bale and brand. In its barrow it trusted,<BR>
its battling and bulwarks: that boast was vain!<BR>
To Beowulf then the bale was told<BR>
quickly and truly: the king's own home,<BR>
of buildings the best, in brand-waves melted,<BR>
that gift-throne of Geats. To the good old man<BR>
sad in heart, 'twas heaviest sorrow.<BR>
The sage assumed that his sovran God<BR>
he had angered, breaking ancient law,<BR>
and embittered the Lord. His breast within<BR>
with black thoughts welled, as his wont was never.<BR>
The folk's own fastness that fiery dragon<BR>
with flame had destroyed, and the stronghold all<BR>
washed by waves; but the warlike king,<BR>
prince of the Weders, plotted vengeance.<BR>
Warriors'-bulwark, he bade them work<BR>
all of iron -- the earl's commander --<BR>
a war-shield wondrous: well he knew<BR>
that forest-wood against fire were worthless,<BR>
linden could aid not. -- Atheling brave,<BR>
he was fated to finish this fleeting life,[1]<BR>
his days on earth, and the dragon with him,<BR>
though long it had watched o'er the wealth of the hoard! --<BR>
Shame he reckoned it, sharer-of-rings,<BR>
to follow the flyer-afar with a host,<BR>
a broad-flung band; nor the battle feared he,<BR>
nor deemed he dreadful the dragon's warring,<BR>
its vigor and valor: ventures desperate<BR>
he had passed a-plenty, and perils of war,<BR>
contest-crash, since, conqueror proud,<BR>
Hrothgar's hall he had wholly purged,<BR>
and in grapple had killed the kin of Grendel,<BR>
loathsome breed! Not least was that<BR>
of hand-to-hand fights where Hygelac fell,<BR>
when the ruler of Geats in rush of battle,<BR>
lord of his folk, in the Frisian land,<BR>
son of Hrethel, by sword-draughts died,<BR>
by brands down-beaten. Thence Beowulf fled<BR>
through strength of himself and his swimming power,<BR>
though alone, and his arms were laden with thirty<BR>
coats of mail, when he came to the sea!<BR>
Nor yet might Hetwaras[2] haughtily boast<BR>
their craft of contest, who carried against him<BR>
shields to the fight: but few escaped<BR>
from strife with the hero to seek their homes!<BR>
Then swam over ocean Ecgtheow's son<BR>
lonely and sorrowful, seeking his land,<BR>
where Hygd made him offer of hoard and realm,<BR>
rings and royal-seat, reckoning naught<BR>
the strength of her son to save their kingdom<BR>
from hostile hordes, after Hygelac's death.<BR>
No sooner for this could the stricken ones<BR>
in any wise move that atheling's mind<BR>
over young Heardred's head as lord<BR>
and ruler of all the realm to be:<BR>
yet the hero upheld him with helpful words,<BR>
aided in honor, till, older grown,<BR>
he wielded the Weder-Geats. -- Wandering exiles<BR>
sought him o'er seas, the sons of Ohtere,<BR>
who had spurned the sway of the Scylfings'-helmet,<BR>
the bravest and best that broke the rings,<BR>
in Swedish land, of the sea-kings' line,<BR>
haughty hero.[3] Hence Heardred's end.<BR>
For shelter he gave them, sword-death came,<BR>
the blade's fell blow, to bairn of Hygelac;<BR>
but the son of Ongentheow sought again<BR>
house and home when Heardred fell,<BR>
leaving Beowulf lord of Geats<BR>
and gift-seat's master. -- A good king he!<BR>

[1] Literally "loan-days," days loaned to man.<BR>
[2] Chattuarii, a tribe that dwelt along the Rhine, and took part in repelling
the raid of (Hygelac) Chocilaicus.<BR>
[3] Onela, son of Ongentheow, who pursues his two nephews Eanmund and
Eadgils to Heardred's court, where they have taken refuge after their un-
successful rebellion. In the fighting Heardred is killed.

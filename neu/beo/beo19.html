<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XVIII</H1>
A CUP she gave him, with kindly greeting<BR>
and winsome words. Of wounden gold,<BR>
she offered, to honor him, arm-jewels twain,<BR>
corselet and rings, and of collars the noblest<BR>
that ever I knew the earth around.<BR>
Ne'er heard I so mighty, 'neath heaven's dome,<BR>
a hoard-gem of heroes, since Hama bore<BR>
to his bright-built burg the Brisings' necklace,<BR>
jewel and gem casket. -- Jealousy fled he,<BR>
Eormenric's hate: chose help eternal.<BR>
Hygelac Geat, grandson of Swerting,<BR>
on the last of his raids this ring bore with him,<BR>
under his banner the booty defending,<BR>
the war-spoil warding; but Wyrd o'erwhelmed him<BR>
what time, in his daring, dangers he sought,<BR>
feud with Frisians. Fairest of gems<BR>
he bore with him over the beaker-of-waves,<BR>
sovran strong: under shield he died.<BR>
Fell the corpse of the king into keeping of Franks,<BR>
gear of the breast, and that gorgeous ring;<BR>
weaker warriors won the spoil,<BR>
after gripe of battle, from Geatland's lord,<BR>
and held the death-field.<BR>
Din rose in hall.<BR>
Wealhtheow spake amid warriors, and said:--<BR>
"This jewel enjoy in thy jocund youth,<BR>
Beowulf lov'd, these battle-weeds wear,<BR>
a royal treasure, and richly thrive!<BR>
Preserve thy strength, and these striplings here<BR>
counsel in kindness: requital be mine.<BR>
Hast done such deeds, that for days to come<BR>
thou art famed among folk both far and near,<BR>
so wide as washeth the wave of Ocean<BR>
his windy walls. Through the ways of life<BR>
prosper, O prince! I pray for thee<BR>
rich possessions. To son of mine<BR>
be helpful in deed and uphold his joys!<BR>
Here every earl to the other is true,<BR>
mild of mood, to the master loyal!<BR>
Thanes are friendly, the throng obedient,<BR>
liegemen are revelling: list and obey!"<BR>
Went then to her place. -- That was proudest of feasts;<BR>
flowed wine for the warriors. Wyrd they knew not,<BR>
destiny dire, and the doom to be seen<BR>
by many an earl when eve should come,<BR>
and Hrothgar homeward hasten away,<BR>
royal, to rest. The room was guarded<BR>
by an army of earls, as erst was done.<BR>
They bared the bench-boards; abroad they spread<BR>
beds and bolsters. -- One beer-carouser<BR>
in danger of doom lay down in the hall. --<BR>
At their heads they set their shields of war,<BR>
bucklers bright; on the bench were there<BR>
over each atheling, easy to see,<BR>
the high battle-helmet, the haughty spear,<BR>
the corselet of rings. 'Twas their custom so<BR>
ever to be for battle prepared,<BR>
at home, or harrying, which it were,<BR>
even as oft as evil threatened<BR>
their sovran king. -- They were clansmen good.<BR>

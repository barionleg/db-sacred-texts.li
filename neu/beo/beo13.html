<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XII</H1>
NOT in any wise would the earls'-defence[1]<BR>
suffer that slaughterous stranger to live,<BR>
useless deeming his days and years<BR>
to men on earth. Now many an earl<BR>
of Beowulf brandished blade ancestral,<BR>
fain the life of their lord to shield,<BR>
their praised prince, if power were theirs;<BR>
never they knew, -- as they neared the foe,<BR>
hardy-hearted heroes of war,<BR>
aiming their swords on every side<BR>
the accursed to kill, -- no keenest blade,<BR>
no farest of falchions fashioned on earth,<BR>
could harm or hurt that hideous fiend!<BR>
He was safe, by his spells, from sword of battle,<BR>
from edge of iron. Yet his end and parting<BR>
on that same day of this our life<BR>
woful should be, and his wandering soul<BR>
far off flit to the fiends' domain.<BR>
Soon he found, who in former days,<BR>
harmful in heart and hated of God,<BR>
on many a man such murder wrought,<BR>
that the frame of his body failed him now.<BR>
For him the keen-souled kinsman of Hygelac<BR>
held in hand; hateful alive<BR>
was each to other. The outlaw dire<BR>
took mortal hurt; a mighty wound<BR>
showed on his shoulder, and sinews cracked,<BR>
and the bone-frame burst. To Beowulf now<BR>
the glory was given, and Grendel thence<BR>
death-sick his den in the dark moor sought,<BR>
noisome abode: he knew too well<BR>
that here was the last of life, an end<BR>
of his days on earth. -- To all the Danes<BR>
by that bloody battle the boon had come.<BR>
From ravage had rescued the roving stranger<BR>
Hrothgar's hall; the hardy and wise one<BR>
had purged it anew. His night-work pleased him,<BR>
his deed and its honor. To Eastern Danes<BR>
had the valiant Geat his vaunt made good,<BR>
all their sorrow and ills assuaged,<BR>
their bale of battle borne so long,<BR>
and all the dole they erst endured<BR>
pain a-plenty. -- 'Twas proof of this,<BR>
when the hardy-in-fight a hand laid down,<BR>
arm and shoulder, -- all, indeed,<BR>
of Grendel's gripe, -- 'neath the gabled roof&#183;<BR>

[1] Kenning for Beowulf.<BR>

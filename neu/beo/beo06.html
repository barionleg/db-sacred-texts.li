STONE-BRIGHT the street:[1] it showed the way<BR>
to the crowd of clansmen. Corselets glistened<BR>
hand-forged, hard; on their harness bright<BR>
the steel ring sang, as they strode along<BR>
in mail of battle, and marched to the hall.<BR>
There, weary of ocean, the wall along<BR>
they set their bucklers, their broad shields, down,<BR>
and bowed them to bench: the breastplates clanged,<BR>
war-gear of men; their weapons stacked,<BR>
spears of the seafarers stood together,<BR>
gray-tipped ash: that iron band<BR>
was worthily weaponed! -- A warrior proud<BR>
asked of the heroes their home and kin.<BR>
"Whence, now, bear ye burnished shields,<BR>
harness gray and helmets grim,<BR>
spears in multitude? Messenger, I,<BR>
Hrothgar's herald! Heroes so many<BR>
ne'er met I as strangers of mood so strong.<BR>
'Tis plain that for prowess, not plunged into exile,<BR>
for high-hearted valor, Hrothgar ye seek!"<BR>
Him the sturdy-in-war bespake with words,<BR>
proud earl of the Weders answer made,<BR>
hardy 'neath helmet:--"Hygelac's, we,<BR>
fellows at board; I am Beowulf named.<BR>
I am seeking to say to the son of Healfdene<BR>
this mission of mine, to thy master-lord,<BR>
the doughty prince, if he deign at all<BR>
grace that we greet him, the good one, now."<BR>
Wulfgar spake, the Wendles' chieftain,<BR>
whose might of mind to many was known,<BR>
his courage and counsel: "The king of Danes,<BR>
the Scyldings' friend, I fain will tell,<BR>
the Breaker-of-Rings, as the boon thou askest,<BR>
the famed prince, of thy faring hither,<BR>
and, swiftly after, such answer bring<BR>
as the doughty monarch may deign to give."<BR>
Hied then in haste to where Hrothgar sat<BR>
white-haired and old, his earls about him,<BR>
till the stout thane stood at the shoulder there<BR>
of the Danish king: good courtier he!<BR>
Wulfgar spake to his winsome lord:--<BR>
"Hither have fared to thee far-come men<BR>
o'er the paths of ocean, people of Geatland;<BR>
and the stateliest there by his sturdy band<BR>
is Beowulf named. This boon they seek,<BR>
that they, my master, may with thee<BR>
have speech at will: nor spurn their prayer<BR>
to give them hearing, gracious Hrothgar!<BR>
In weeds of the warrior worthy they,<BR>
methinks, of our liking; their leader most surely,<BR>
a hero that hither his henchmen has led."<BR>

[1] Either merely paved, the strata via of the Romans, or else thought of
as a sort of mosaic, an extravagant touch like the reckless waste of gold
on the walls and roofs of a hall.<BR>

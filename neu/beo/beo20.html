<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XIX</H1>
THEN sank they to sleep. With sorrow one bought<BR>
his rest of the evening, -- as ofttime had happened<BR>
when Grendel guarded that golden hall,<BR>
evil wrought, till his end drew nigh,<BR>
slaughter for sins. 'Twas seen and told<BR>
how an avenger survived the fiend,<BR>
as was learned afar. The livelong time<BR>
after that grim fight, Grendel's mother,<BR>
monster of women, mourned her woe.<BR>
She was doomed to dwell in the dreary waters,<BR>
cold sea-courses, since Cain cut down<BR>
with edge of the sword his only brother,<BR>
his father's offspring: outlawed he fled,<BR>
marked with murder, from men's delights<BR>
warded the wilds. -- There woke from him<BR>
such fate-sent ghosts as Grendel, who,<BR>
war-wolf horrid, at Heorot found<BR>
a warrior watching and waiting the fray,<BR>
with whom the grisly one grappled amain.<BR>
But the man remembered his mighty power,<BR>
the glorious gift that God had sent him,<BR>
in his Maker's mercy put his trust<BR>
for comfort and help: so he conquered the foe,<BR>
felled the fiend, who fled abject,<BR>
reft of joy, to the realms of death,<BR>
mankind's foe. And his mother now,<BR>
gloomy and grim, would go that quest<BR>
of sorrow, the death of her son to avenge.<BR>
To Heorot came she, where helmeted Danes<BR>
slept in the hall. Too soon came back<BR>
old ills of the earls, when in she burst,<BR>
the mother of Grendel. Less grim, though, that terror,<BR>
e'en as terror of woman in war is less,<BR>
might of maid, than of men in arms<BR>
when, hammer-forged, the falchion hard,<BR>
sword gore-stained, through swine of the helm,<BR>
crested, with keen blade carves amain.<BR>
Then was in hall the hard-edge drawn,<BR>
the swords on the settles,[1] and shields a-many<BR>
firm held in hand: nor helmet minded<BR>
nor harness of mail, whom that horror seized.<BR>
Haste was hers; she would hie afar<BR>
and save her life when the liegemen saw her.<BR>
Yet a single atheling up she seized<BR>
fast and firm, as she fled to the moor.<BR>
He was for Hrothgar of heroes the dearest,<BR>
of trusty vassals betwixt the seas,<BR>
whom she killed on his couch, a clansman famous,<BR>
in battle brave. -- Nor was Beowulf there;<BR>
another house had been held apart,<BR>
after giving of gold, for the Geat renowned. --<BR>
Uproar filled Heorot; the hand all had viewed,<BR>
blood-flecked, she bore with her; bale was returned,<BR>
dole in the dwellings: 'twas dire exchange<BR>
where Dane and Geat were doomed to give<BR>
the lives of loved ones. Long-tried king,<BR>
the hoary hero, at heart was sad<BR>
when he knew his noble no more lived,<BR>
and dead indeed was his dearest thane.<BR>
To his bower was Beowulf brought in haste,<BR>
dauntless victor. As daylight broke,<BR>
along with his earls the atheling lord,<BR>
with his clansmen, came where the king abode<BR>
waiting to see if the Wielder-of-All<BR>
would turn this tale of trouble and woe.<BR>
Strode o'er floor the famed-in-strife,<BR>
with his hand-companions, -- the hall resounded, --<BR>
wishing to greet the wise old king,<BR>
Ingwines' lord; he asked if the night<BR>
had passed in peace to the prince's mind.<BR>

[1] They had laid their arms on the benches near where they slept.<BR>

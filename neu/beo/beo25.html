<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XXIV</H1>
BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<BR>
"Lo, now, this sea-booty, son of Healfdene,<BR>
Lord of Scyldings, we've lustily brought thee,<BR>
sign of glory; thou seest it here.<BR>
Not lightly did I with my life escape!<BR>
In war under water this work I essayed<BR>
with endless effort; and even so<BR>
my strength had been lost had the Lord not shielded me.<BR>
Not a whit could I with Hrunting do<BR>
in work of war, though the weapon is good;<BR>
yet a sword the Sovran of Men vouchsafed me<BR>
to spy on the wall there, in splendor hanging,<BR>
old, gigantic, -- how oft He guides<BR>
the friendless wight! -- and I fought with that brand,<BR>
felling in fight, since fate was with me,<BR>
the house's wardens. That war-sword then<BR>
all burned, bright blade, when the blood gushed o'er it,<BR>
battle-sweat hot; but the hilt I brought back<BR>
from my foes. So avenged I their fiendish deeds<BR>
death-fall of Danes, as was due and right.<BR>
And this is my hest, that in Heorot now<BR>
safe thou canst sleep with thy soldier band,<BR>
and every thane of all thy folk<BR>
both old and young; no evil fear,<BR>
Scyldings' lord, from that side again,<BR>
aught ill for thy earls, as erst thou must!"<BR>
Then the golden hilt, for that gray-haired leader,<BR>
hoary hero, in hand was laid,<BR>
giant-wrought, old. So owned and enjoyed it<BR>
after downfall of devils, the Danish lord,<BR>
wonder-smiths' work, since the world was rid<BR>
of that grim-souled fiend, the foe of God,<BR>
murder-marked, and his mother as well.<BR>
Now it passed into power of the people's king,<BR>
best of all that the oceans bound<BR>
who have scattered their gold o'er Scandia's isle.<BR>
Hrothgar spake -- the hilt he viewed,<BR>
heirloom old, where was etched the rise<BR>
of that far-off fight when the floods o'erwhelmed,<BR>
raging waves, the race of giants<BR>
(fearful their fate!), a folk estranged<BR>
from God Eternal: whence guerdon due<BR>
in that waste of waters the Wielder paid them.<BR>
So on the guard of shining gold<BR>
in runic staves it was rightly said<BR>
for whom the serpent-traced sword was wrought,<BR>
best of blades, in bygone days,<BR>
and the hilt well wound. -- The wise-one spake,<BR>
son of Healfdene; silent were all:--<BR>
"Lo, so may he say who sooth and right<BR>
follows 'mid folk, of far times mindful,<BR>
a land-warden old,[1] that this earl belongs<BR>
to the better breed! So, borne aloft,<BR>
thy fame must fly, O friend my Beowulf,<BR>
far and wide o'er folksteads many. Firmly thou<BR>
shalt all maintain,<BR>
mighty strength with mood of wisdom. Love of<BR>
mine will I assure thee,<BR>
as, awhile ago, I promised; thou shalt prove a stay in future,<BR>
in far-off years, to folk of thine,<BR>
to the heroes a help. Was not Heremod thus<BR>
to offspring of Ecgwela, Honor-Scyldings,<BR>
nor grew for their grace, but for grisly slaughter,<BR>
for doom of death to the Danishmen.<BR>
He slew, wrath-swollen, his shoulder-comrades,<BR>
companions at board! So he passed alone,<BR>
chieftain haughty, from human cheer.<BR>
Though him the Maker with might endowed,<BR>
delights of power, and uplifted high<BR>
above all men, yet blood-fierce his mind,<BR>
his breast-hoard, grew, no bracelets gave he<BR>
to Danes as was due; he endured all joyless<BR>
strain of struggle and stress of woe,<BR>
long feud with his folk. Here find thy lesson!<BR>
Of virtue advise thee! This verse I have said for thee,<BR>
wise from lapsed winters. Wondrous seems<BR>
how to sons of men Almighty God<BR>
in the strength of His spirit sendeth wisdom,<BR>
estate, high station: He swayeth all things.<BR>
Whiles He letteth right lustily fare<BR>
the heart of the hero of high-born race, --<BR>
in seat ancestral assigns him bliss,<BR>
his folk's sure fortress in fee to hold,<BR>
puts in his power great parts of the earth,<BR>
empire so ample, that end of it<BR>
this wanter-of-wisdom weeneth none.<BR>
So he waxes in wealth, nowise can harm him<BR>
illness or age; no evil cares<BR>
shadow his spirit; no sword-hate threatens<BR>
from ever an enemy: all the world<BR>
wends at his will, no worse he knoweth,<BR>
till all within him obstinate pride<BR>
waxes and wakes while the warden slumbers,<BR>
the spirit's sentry; sleep is too fast<BR>
which masters his might, and the murderer nears,<BR>
stealthily shooting the shafts from his bow!<BR>

[1] That is, "whoever has as wide authority as I have and can remember
so far back so many instances of heroism, may well say, as I say, that no
better hero ever lived than Beowulf."<BR>

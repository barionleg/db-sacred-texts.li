<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">IX</H1>
ME thus often the evil monsters<BR>
thronging threatened. With thrust of my sword,<BR>
the darling, I dealt them due return!<BR>
Nowise had they bliss from their booty then<BR>
to devour their victim, vengeful creatures,<BR>
seated to banquet at bottom of sea;<BR>
but at break of day, by my brand sore hurt,<BR>
on the edge of ocean up they lay,<BR>
put to sleep by the sword. And since, by them<BR>
on the fathomless sea-ways sailor-folk<BR>
are never molested. -- Light from east,<BR>
came bright God's beacon; the billows sank,<BR>
so that I saw the sea-cliffs high,<BR>
windy walls. For Wyrd oft saveth<BR>
earl undoomed if he doughty be!<BR>
And so it came that I killed with my sword<BR>
nine of the nicors. Of night-fought battles<BR>
ne'er heard I a harder 'neath heaven's dome,<BR>
nor adrift on the deep a more desolate man!<BR>
Yet I came unharmed from that hostile clutch,<BR>
though spent with swimming. The sea upbore me,<BR>
flood of the tide, on Finnish land,<BR>
the welling waters. No wise of thee<BR>
have I heard men tell such terror of falchions,<BR>
bitter battle. Breca ne'er yet,<BR>
not one of you pair, in the play of war<BR>
such daring deed has done at all<BR>
with bloody brand, -- I boast not of it! --<BR>
though thou wast the bane[1] of thy brethren dear,<BR>
thy closest kin, whence curse of hell<BR>
awaits thee, well as thy wit may serve!<BR>
For I say in sooth, thou son of Ecglaf,<BR>
never had Grendel these grim deeds wrought,<BR>
monster dire, on thy master dear,<BR>
in Heorot such havoc, if heart of thine<BR>
were as battle-bold as thy boast is loud!<BR>
But he has found no feud will happen;<BR>
from sword-clash dread of your Danish clan<BR>
he vaunts him safe, from the Victor-Scyldings.<BR>
He forces pledges, favors none<BR>
of the land of Danes, but lustily murders,<BR>
fights and feasts, nor feud he dreads<BR>
from Spear-Dane men. But speedily now<BR>
shall I prove him the prowess and pride of the Geats,<BR>
shall bid him battle. Blithe to mead<BR>
go he that listeth, when light of dawn<BR>
this morrow morning o'er men of earth,<BR>
ether-robed sun from the south shall beam!"<BR>
Joyous then was the Jewel-giver,<BR>
hoar-haired, war-brave; help awaited<BR>
the Bright-Danes' prince, from Beowulf hearing,<BR>
folk's good shepherd, such firm resolve.<BR>
Then was laughter of liegemen loud resounding<BR>
with winsome words. Came Wealhtheow forth,<BR>
queen of Hrothgar, heedful of courtesy,<BR>
gold-decked, greeting the guests in hall;<BR>
and the high-born lady handed the cup<BR>
first to the East-Danes' heir and warden,<BR>
bade him be blithe at the beer-carouse,<BR>
the land's beloved one. Lustily took he<BR>
banquet and beaker, battle-famed king.<BR>
Through the hall then went the Helmings' Lady,<BR>
to younger and older everywhere<BR>
carried the cup, till come the moment<BR>
when the ring-graced queen, the royal-hearted,<BR>
to Beowulf bore the beaker of mead.<BR>
She greeted the Geats' lord, God she thanked,<BR>
in wisdom's words, that her will was granted,<BR>
that at last on a hero her hope could lean<BR>
for comfort in terrors. The cup he took,<BR>
hardy-in-war, from Wealhtheow's hand,<BR>
and answer uttered the eager-for-combat.<BR>
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<BR>
"This was my thought, when my thanes and I<BR>
bent to the ocean and entered our boat,<BR>
that I would work the will of your people<BR>
fully, or fighting fall in death,<BR>
in fiend's gripe fast. I am firm to do<BR>
an earl's brave deed, or end the days<BR>
of this life of mine in the mead-hall here."<BR>
Well these words to the woman seemed,<BR>
Beowulf's battle-boast. -- Bright with gold<BR>
the stately dame by her spouse sat down.<BR>
Again, as erst, began in hall<BR>
warriors' wassail and words of power,<BR>
the proud-band's revel, till presently<BR>
the son of Healfdene hastened to seek<BR>
rest for the night; he knew there waited<BR>
fight for the fiend in that festal hall,<BR>
when the sheen of the sun they saw no more,<BR>
and dusk of night sank darkling nigh,<BR>
and shadowy shapes came striding on,<BR>
wan under welkin. The warriors rose.<BR>
Man to man, he made harangue,<BR>
Hrothgar to Beowulf, bade him hail,<BR>
let him wield the wine hall: a word he added:--<BR>
"Never to any man erst I trusted,<BR>
since I could heave up hand and shield,<BR>
this noble Dane-Hall, till now to thee.<BR>
Have now and hold this house unpeered;<BR>
remember thy glory; thy might declare;<BR>
watch for the foe! No wish shall fail thee<BR>
if thou bidest the battle with bold-won life."<BR>

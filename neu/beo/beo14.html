<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XIII</H1>
MANY at morning, as men have told me,<BR>
warriors gathered the gift-hall round,<BR>
folk-leaders faring from far and near,<BR>
o'er wide-stretched ways, the wonder to view,<BR>
trace of the traitor. Not troublous seemed<BR>
the enemy's end to any man<BR>
who saw by the gait of the graceless foe<BR>
how the weary-hearted, away from thence,<BR>
baffled in battle and banned, his steps<BR>
death-marked dragged to the devils' mere.<BR>
Bloody the billows were boiling there,<BR>
turbid the tide of tumbling waves<BR>
horribly seething, with sword-blood hot,<BR>
by that doomed one dyed, who in den of the moor<BR>
laid forlorn his life adown,<BR>
his heathen soul,-and hell received it.<BR>
Home then rode the hoary clansmen<BR>
from that merry journey, and many a youth,<BR>
on horses white, the hardy warriors,<BR>
back from the mere. Then Beowulf's glory<BR>
eager they echoed, and all averred<BR>
that from sea to sea, or south or north,<BR>
there was no other in earth's domain,<BR>
under vault of heaven, more valiant found,<BR>
of warriors none more worthy to rule!<BR>
(On their lord beloved they laid no slight,<BR>
gracious Hrothgar: a good king he!)<BR>
From time to time, the tried-in-battle<BR>
their gray steeds set to gallop amain,<BR>
and ran a race when the road seemed fair.<BR>
From time to time, a thane of the king,<BR>
who had made many vaunts, and was mindful of verses,<BR>
stored with sagas and songs of old,<BR>
bound word to word in well-knit rime,<BR>
welded his lay; this warrior soon<BR>
of Beowulf's quest right cleverly sang,<BR>
and artfully added an excellent tale,<BR>
in well-ranged words, of the warlike deeds<BR>
he had heard in saga of Sigemund.<BR>
Strange the story: he said it all, --<BR>
the Waelsing's wanderings wide, his struggles,<BR>
which never were told to tribes of men,<BR>
the feuds and the frauds, save to Fitela only,<BR>
when of these doings he deigned to speak,<BR>
uncle to nephew; as ever the twain<BR>
stood side by side in stress of war,<BR>
and multitude of the monster kind<BR>
they had felled with their swords. Of Sigemund grew,<BR>
when he passed from life, no little praise;<BR>
for the doughty-in-combat a dragon killed<BR>
that herded the hoard:[1] under hoary rock<BR>
the atheling dared the deed alone<BR>
fearful quest, nor was Fitela there.<BR>
Yet so it befell, his falchion pierced<BR>
that wondrous worm, -- on the wall it struck,<BR>
best blade; the dragon died in its blood.<BR>
Thus had the dread-one by daring achieved<BR>
over the ring-hoard to rule at will,<BR>
himself to pleasure; a sea-boat he loaded,<BR>
and bore on its bosom the beaming gold,<BR>
son of Waels; the worm was consumed.<BR>
He had of all heroes the highest renown<BR>
among races of men, this refuge-of-warriors,<BR>
for deeds of daring that decked his name<BR>
since the hand and heart of Heremod<BR>
grew slack in battle. He, swiftly banished<BR>
to mingle with monsters at mercy of foes,<BR>
to death was betrayed; for torrents of sorrow<BR>
had lamed him too long; a load of care<BR>
to earls and athelings all he proved.<BR>
Oft indeed, in earlier days,<BR>
for the warrior's wayfaring wise men mourned,<BR>
who had hoped of him help from harm and bale,<BR>
and had thought their sovran's son would thrive,<BR>
follow his father, his folk protect,<BR>
the hoard and the stronghold, heroes' land,<BR>
home of Scyldings. -- But here, thanes said,<BR>
the kinsman of Hygelac kinder seemed<BR>
to all: the other[2] was urged to crime!<BR>
And afresh to the race,[3] the fallow roads<BR>
by swift steeds measured! The morning sun<BR>
was climbing higher. Clansmen hastened<BR>
to the high-built hall, those hardy-minded,<BR>
the wonder to witness. Warden of treasure,<BR>
crowned with glory, the king himself,<BR>
with stately band from the bride-bower strode;<BR>
and with him the queen and her crowd of maidens<BR>
measured the path to the mead-house fair.<BR>

[1] "Guarded the treasure."<BR>
[2] Sc. Heremod.<BR>
[3] The singer has sung his lays, and the epic resumes its story. The
time-relations are not altogether good in this long passage which describes
the rejoicings of "the day after"; but the present shift from the riders
on the road to the folk at the hall is not very violent, and is of a piece
with the general style.<BR>

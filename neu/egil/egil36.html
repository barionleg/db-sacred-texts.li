<CENTER>CHAPTER XXXV.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Thorolf goes abroad.</I><BR>
<BR>
</CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thora bare a child in the summer; it was a girl.  She was sprinkled with water, and named Asgerdr.  Bera got a woman to look after the girl.  Bjorn stayed for the winter with Skallagrim as did all his shipmates.  Thorolf struck up a friendship with Bjorn, and was ever in his company.  But when spring came, one day Thorolf had a talk with his father, and asked him what counsel he would give about Bjorn his winter guest, or what help he would lend him.  Grim asked Thorolf what Bjorn had in view.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I think,' said Thorolf, 'that Bjorn would soonest go to Norway, if he could be there in peace.  Methinks, father, this plan lies before us, that you send men to Norway to offer atonement for Bjorn; Thorir will greatly honour your word.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorolf by his persuasion so managed that Skallagrim yielded and gave men for the outward voyage that summer.  These went with message and tokens to Thorir Hroaldsson, and sought atonement between him and Bjorn.  But no sooner did Brynjolf hear this than he, too, set his whole mind to offer atonement for Bjorn.  And the end of this matter was that Thorir took atonement for Bjorn, because he saw that it had come to this now that Bjorn had nothing to fear.  Thus Brynjolf got atonement accepted for Bjorn, and Skallagrim's messengers abode with Thorir for the winter.  In the summer following they went back; and on their coming back in autumn they told their tidings that Bjorn was admitted to atonement in Norway.  Bjorn was with Skallagrim for yet a third winter.  But next spring he made him ready for departure with his following.  And when Bjorn was ready for going, then Bera said she would fain have Asgerdr, her foster-child, left-behind.  This Bjorn accepted, and the girl was left behind and brought up with Skallagrim's family.  Thorolf, Skallagrim's son, settled to go with Bjorn, and Skallagrim gave him mean for the journey.  So he went abroad in the summer with Bjorn.  Their voyage sped well, and they came off the main into Sogn-sea.  Bjorn then sailed into Sogn, and thence on home to his father, and Thorolf with him.  Brynjolf received them joyfully.  Then word was sent to Thorir Hroaldsson.  He and Brynjolf set a time for a meeting; to this meeting Bjorn also came.  He and Thorir there ratified their atonement.  Then Thorir paid out of hand such property in his house as belonged to Thora; and thereafter Thorir and Bjorn were good brothers-in-law and friends.  Bjorn then stayed at home at Aurland with Brynjolf, Thorolf also being there in much favour both with father and son.<BR>

<CENTER>CHAPTER XX.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Skallagrim's marriage.</I><BR>
<BR>
</CENTER>There was a man named Yngvar, powerful and wealthy.  He had been a baron of the former kings.  But after Harold came to the throne, Yngvar sate at home and served not the king.  Yngvar was married and had a daughter named Bera.  Yngvar dwelt in the Firths.  Bera was his only child and heiress.  Grim Kveldulf's son asked Bera to wife, and the match was arranged.  Grim took Bera in the winter following the summer when Thorolf had parted from him and his father.<BR>
Grim was then twenty-five years old, and was now bald, wherefore he was henceforth called Skallagrim.  He had then the management of all the farms belonging to his father and himself and of all the produce, though Kveldulf was yet a hale and strong man.  They had many freedmen about them, and many men who had grown up there at home and were about Skallagrim's equals in age.  Men of prowess and strength they were mostly, for both father and son chose strong fellows to be their followers, and trained them after their mind.  Skallagrim was like his father in stature and strength, as also in face and temper.<BR>

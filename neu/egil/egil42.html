<CENTER>CHAPTER XLI.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Of Bjorn.</I><BR>
<BR>
</CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bjorn got for his portion another good and valuable homestead.  He did not become a liege-man of the king, wherefore he was called Bjorn Yeoman.  He was right wealthy, and a great man.  No sooner did Thorolf come off the sea then he went at once to Bjorn, and brought him Asgerdr his daughter.  There was a joyful meeting.  Asgerdr was a most beautiful and accomplished woman, wise and right skilful.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorolf went to see king Eric.  And when they met, Thorolf greeted Eric from Skallagrim, and said that he had thankfully received the king's gift.  He then brought out a good long-ship's sail, which he said Skallagrim had sent to the king.  King Eric received the gift well, and bade Thorolf be with him for the winter.  For this Thorolf thanked the king, but said: 'I must first go to Thorir; with him I have an urgent errand.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Thorolf went to Thorir, as he had said, and met there a right hearty welcome.  Thorir bade him be with him.  This Thorolf said he would accept; 'and there is,' said he, 'one with me who must have lodging where I am; he is my brother, and he has never before been away from home, and he needs that I look after him.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorir said that Thorolf had every right, if he would, to bring more men with him thither.  'Your brother, too,' said he, 'we think, betters our company if he be at all like you.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Thorolf went to his ship, and had it drawn up and made snug, whereafter he and Egil went to lord Thorir.  Thorir had a son named Arinbjorn, who was somewhat older than Egil.  Arinbjorn early showed himself a manly fellow and a doughty.  With Arinbjorn Egil struck up a friendship, and was ever his follower.  But between the brothers was rather a coolness.<BR>

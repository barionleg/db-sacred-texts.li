<H1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XVI</H1> 
TITLE I.
<P>
This High History saith that Messire Gawain and Lancelot were
repaired to the court of King Arthur from the quest they had
achieved.  The King made great joy thereof and the Queen.  King
Arthur sate one day at meat by the side of the Queen, and they
had been served of the first meats.  Thereupon come two knights
all armed, and each bore a dead knight before him, and the
knights were still armed as they had been when their bodies were
alive.
<P>
"Sir," say the knights, "This shame and this mischief is yours.
In like manner will you lose all your knights betimes and God
love you not well enough to give counsel herein forthwith of his
mercy."
<P>
"Lords," saith the King, "How came these knights to be in so evil
case?"
<P>
"Sir," say they, "It is of good right you ought to know.  The
Knight of the Fiery Dragon is entered into the head of your land,
and is destroying knights and castles and whatsoever he may lay
hands on, in such sort that none durst contend against him, for
he is taller by a foot than any knight ever you had, and of
grisly cheer, and so is his sword three times bigger than the
sword of ever another knight, and his spear is well as heavy as a
man may carry.  Two knights might lightly cover them of his
shield, and it hath on the outer side the head of a dragon that
casteth forth fire and flame whensoever he will, so eager and
biting that none may long endure his encounter."
<P>
<P>
II.
<P>
"None other, how strong soever he be, may stand against him, and,
even as you see, hath he burnt and evil-entreated all other
knights that have withstood him."
<P>
"From what land hath come such manner of man?"
<P>
"Sir," say the knights, "He is come from the Giant's castle, and
he warreth upon you for the love of Logrin the Giant, whose head
Messire Kay brought you into your court, nor never, saith he,
will he have joy until such time as he shall have avenged him on
your body or upon the knight that you love best."
<P>
"Our Lord God," saith the King, "Will defend us from so evil a
man."
<P>
He is risen from the table, all scared, and maketh carry the two
dead knights to be buried, and the others turn back again when
they have told their message.  The King calleth Messire Gawain
and Lancelot and asketh them what he shall do of this knight that
is entered into his land?
<P>
"By my head, I know not what to say, save you give counsel
herein."
<P>
"Sir," saith Lancelot, "We will go against him, so please you, I
and Messire Gawain between us."
<P>
"By my head," saith the King, "I would not let you go for a
kingdom, for such man as is this is no knight but a devil and a
fiend that hath issued from the borders of Hell.  I say not but
that it were great worship and prize to slay and conquer him, but
he that should go against him should set his own life in right
sore jeopardy and run great hazard of being in as bad plight as
these two knights I have seen."
<P>
The King was in such dismay that he knew not neither what to say
nor to do, and so was all the court likewise in such sort as no
knight neither one nor another was minded to go to battle with
him, and so remained the court in great dismay.
